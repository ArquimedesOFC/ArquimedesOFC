I'm a backend-focused software developer from Brazil with a strong interest in building scalable systems and working with Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I contribute to digital solutions in a corporate environment, where I work with backend logic, data-driven processes, and real-world software projects. I enjoy designing clean APIs, organizing system structure, and improving performance.

## What I Work With

- Python, Java
- FastAPI, Django, Flask
- REST APIs
- MySQL, SQL Server
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face
- Microsoft Azure
- Git & Linux environments

## What I Care About

I care about writing structured code, keeping systems maintainable, and understanding how things work under the hood.  
I'm especially interested in backend architecture and integrating AI models into practical applications.

I'm continuously improving my skills and building projects that reflect real backend and AI use cases.
